# Old C Projects

Projects I did a few years ago (between 2009 and 2010) when I was a student.

Using C standard library was forbidden for some project so I reinvented the wheel a few times.

I used to develop on FreeBsd when I did this projects. Some are also working
under Linux/Unix environment, but others won't work.
